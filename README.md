# N-Queens-Problems-Algorithms
This contains four algorithms for solving N-Queens Problems.
- `Brute Force` algorithm
- `Backtracking` algorithm
- `Heuristic Value Based` algorithm
- `Genetic` algorithm  
These algorithms are used to compare the run time and performance in solving N-Queens Problems.
